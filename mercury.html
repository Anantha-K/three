                    Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest one to the Sun. It’s a rocky planet that looks a bit like the Moon, with a surface full of craters and rocky terrain. Because it’s so close to the Sun, Mercury experiences wild temperature changes—super hot during the day and super cold at night!
                     Think of it as the tiny, speedy planet that loves to play extreme games! <br/><br/>
                     <br/><b> Speedy Little Racer</b>: Mercury zips around the Sun faster than any other planet, traveling at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second). If it were in a race, it would win every time—zoom, zoom!
                     <br/><b>No Friends (Moons)</b>: Mercury has no moons. It’s a bit like the kid on the playground who likes to play solo, running around the Sun all by itself!
<br/><b>Daydreaming</b>: A day on Mercury (one full rotation) lasts about 59 Earth days, but it only takes 88 Earth days to orbit the Sun. So, if Mercury were your friend, it would take forever to wake up!
 <br/><b>Sunny Side Up</b>: Because it has a very thin atmosphere, Mercury doesn’t hold heat. It’s like being outside on a sunny day with no sunscreen—burnt one moment and freezing the next!
<br/><b>Bumpy Journey</b>: If you could stand on Mercury, you’d see a sky full of stars all day long! Since it has no atmosphere, the Sun shines bright and the stars never disappear, even during the day!      </p>      </div>
