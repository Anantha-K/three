              <p style="color: rgb(251, 251, 251)"class="card-text">The Sun is a gigantic ball of hot, glowing gases at the center of our solar system. It’s about 93 million miles away from Earth, and it’s what makes our days bright and warm. The Sun is like a big cosmic campfire, giving off light and heat, and it’s so massive that it could fit over 1 million Earths inside it!<br/><br/>
                <b>Big Ball of Fire</b>: Imagine a giant fireball that’s 1.3 million times bigger than Earth! That’s the Sun! It’s like the biggest pizza in the universe, and it’s always on fire!
              <br>  <b>Super Hot</b>: The Sun's surface is about 5,500°C (9,932°F). That’s hotter than your oven on bake mode! If you stood on the Sun, you'd be toast—literally!
               <br> <b>Solar Dance Party</b>: The Sun has its own dance moves! It spins on its axis, taking about 27 days to do a full spin. It’s like a giant disco ball in space, spinning and shining!<br/>
              <b>Light Speed</b>: The Sun is a speedy superhero! It takes just 8 minutes for sunlight to travel to Earth. So, when you see the Sun shining, that light actually left the Sun 8 minutes ago!
                <br>
               <b>Solar Family</b>: The Sun is the superstar of our solar system, holding 99.86% of its mass. It keeps all the planets, asteroids, and comets in a big cosmic hug!
               <br>
              <b> Magnetic Might</b>: The Sun has a super strong magnetic field that can create space weather. Sometimes, it throws a solar tantrum called a solar flare, sending bursts of energy into space!
               <br>
              <b> Nightlight for the Universe</b>: If you think the Sun is bright, you should see it from space! Astronauts say it’s like having the world’s brightest nightlight shining on you!

                    Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest one to the Sun. It’s a rocky planet that looks a bit like the Moon, with a surface full of craters and rocky terrain. Because it’s so close to the Sun, Mercury experiences wild temperature changes—super hot during the day and super cold at night!
                     Think of it as the tiny, speedy planet that loves to play extreme games! <br/><br/>
                     <br/><b> Speedy Little Racer</b>: Mercury zips around the Sun faster than any other planet, traveling at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second). If it were in a race, it would win every time—zoom, zoom!
                     <br/><b>No Friends (Moons)</b>: Mercury has no moons. It’s a bit like the kid on the playground who likes to play solo, running around the Sun all by itself!
<br/><b>Daydreaming</b>: A day on Mercury (one full rotation) lasts about 59 Earth days, but it only takes 88 Earth days to orbit the Sun. So, if Mercury were your friend, it would take forever to wake up!
 <br/><b>Sunny Side Up</b>: Because it has a very thin atmosphere, Mercury doesn’t hold heat. It’s like being outside on a sunny day with no sunscreen—burnt one moment and freezing the next!
<br/><b>Bumpy Journey</b>: If you could stand on Mercury, you’d see a sky full of stars all day long! Since it has no atmosphere, the Sun shines bright and the stars never disappear, even during the day!      </p>      </div>

                Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth’s “sister planet” because they’re similar in size and composition. However, Venus is very different in many ways! It has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid clouds, which trap heat. This makes Venus the hottest planet in our solar system, even though it’s not the closest to the Sun!<br/><br/>
            <b>Hottest Planet</b>: Venus is like a giant oven, with surface temperatures around 462°C (864°F). If you tried to bake cookies there, they’d be done in a flash—if they didn’t melt first!<br/>
        <b>Pressure Cooker</b>: The atmospheric pressure on Venus is about 92 times that of Earth, which is like being a deep-sea diver without any gear! It’s like Venus is giving everything a big bear hug!<br/>
    <b> Beauty Contest</b>: Venus is often called the “Evening Star” or “Morning Star” because it’s so bright. If planets had a beauty contest, Venus would definitely win the title of “Miss Bright and Shiny”!<br/>
<b>No Moons or Rings</b>: Venus is a lone planet, having no moons or rings. It’s the independent type who prefers to hang out by itself!<br/>
<b>Retro Fashion</b>: Venus rotates so slowly that a day on Venus takes longer than a year! It’s like the planet is wearing retro clothes and taking its time to strut down the runway!<br/> </p>

            <b>Earth’s Birthday</b>: Earth is about 4.5 billion years old! That’s like having a birthday cake so big it would take all day to slice it!<br/>
            <b> Breathe Easy</b>: Earth’s atmosphere is made up of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, which means we have the perfect mix to breathe and stay alive. It’s like having a magic potion for life!<br/>
            <b> A Planet of Seasons</b>: Earth experiences four seasons—spring, summer, autumn, and winter—because it tilts on its axis. It’s like a giant wardrobe change every few months!<br/>
            <b>Home of the Animals</b>: Earth is home to more than 8.7 million species of plants and animals. That’s like a massive zoo where you can find everything from tiny bugs to giant whales!<br/>

                Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often called the "Red Planet" because of its reddish appearance, which comes from iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It’s a rocky planet with mountains, valleys, and even the largest volcano in the solar system, called Olympus Mons. Mars is known for its thin atmosphere and is a favorite for scientists and space explorers who dream of sending humans there one day!<br/><br/>
            <b>Red Wonder</b>: Mars is often called the “Red Planet,” but did you know it’s also sometimes called the “Desert Planet”? It’s like a giant rusty playground with lots of cool features!<br/>
        <b>Dusty Dancer</b>: Mars experiences massive dust storms that can cover the entire planet! It’s like Mars throwing a giant party and getting all dusty—everyone’s invited!<br/>
    <b>Two Tiny Moons</b>: Mars has two small moons named Phobos and Deimos. They look more like space potatoes than actual moons! Imagine roasting those for a cosmic snack!<br/>
<b>Chilly Temperatures</b>: Mars is really cold! Temperatures can drop to -80°F (-62°C) at night. If you were on Mars, you’d definitely want to wear your warmest pajamas!<br/>

                Largest planet in our solar system, known as a gas giant. It’s made mostly of hydrogen and helium and has a swirling atmosphere with beautiful bands of clouds in shades of orange, brown, and white. Jupiter is famous for its Great Red Spot, a giant storm that’s been raging for hundreds of years—kind of like the biggest hurricane ever! Jupiter also has an impressive number of moons, with over 79 known so far, including its four largest, called the Galilean moons.<br/><br/>
                <b> Biggest Planet</b>: Jupiter is so huge that it could fit over 1,300 Earths inside it! It’s like the ultimate cosmic giant—think of it as the friendly giant of the solar system!<br/>
            <b>No Solid Surface</b>: Unlike Earth, Jupiter doesn’t have a solid surface to stand on. If you tried to land, you’d just sink into the clouds, like jumping into a fluffy cotton candy cloud!<br/>
        <b> Great Red Spot</b>: Jupiter’s Great Red Spot is a massive storm that’s bigger than Earth! If it were a party, it would be the biggest and windiest bash in space—better hold onto your hats!<br/>
    <b> Super Fast Spin</b>: Jupiter spins really fast on its axis, taking only about 10 hours to complete one rotation. It’s like the planet has had too much space coffee and can’t sit still!<br/>

With its many moons and unique features, Saturn looks like a giant jewel in space!<br/><br/>
                <b>Ring Master</b>: Saturn has the most magnificent rings of any planet! If it were a person, it would definitely wear the fanciest jewelry in the universe—like a superstar at a red carpet event!<br/>

            The seventh planet from the Sun and is known for its striking blue color, which comes from methane gas in its atmosphere. It’s a gas giant, just like Jupiter and Saturn, but it’s unique because it spins on its side! This means its rings and moons also orbit in a tilted position, making Uranus look like it’s rolling through space. It’s a chilly planet, far away from the warmth of the Sun!<br/><br/>
            <b>Tilted King</b>: Uranus is the only planet that rotates on its side, with an axial tilt of about 98 degrees. It’s like the planet decided to do a cartwheel and just kept going!<br/>
            <b>Ring-a-Ding</b>: Uranus has a set of faint rings, but they’re not as flashy as Saturn’s. They’re like the quiet cousins at the family gathering—still important but not stealing the show!<br/>
            <b>Far Away Friend</b>: Uranus is about 1.9 billion miles from the Sun, which means it takes a long time to complete one orbit—about 84 Earth years! If you were on Uranus, you’d have to wait a long time for your birthday!<br/>
            <b>Blue and Green</b>: Uranus has a beautiful blue-green color, making it look like a giant ice giant in space. If it were a flavor of ice cream, it would definitely be mint chocolate chip!<br/>

                The Moon is a big, round rock that travels around our planet, Earth. It's like Earth's best buddy in space! The Moon shines at night because it reflects sunlight, and sometimes you can even see its craters and mountains through a telescope. It helps create ocean tides and has inspired countless stories and songs. Plus, it's the only place outside of Earth where astronauts have walked!<br/><br/>
            <b>Moonwalking</b>: Astronauts who visited the Moon did a special dance called "moonwalking." They bounced around because the Moon has less gravity than Earth. So, they felt super light and springy!<br/>
            <b>Moonlight is Just Sunlight</b>: The light we see from the Moon is actually sunlight bouncing off its surface. So, when you see the Moon shining, it’s like a giant mirror in the sky!<br/>
            <b>A Month is Based on the Moon</b>: The word "month" comes from the Moon! That's why some months have 28 or 29 days—just like the Moon takes about 29 days to go around Earth.<br/>
            <b>Moon Quakes</b>: Just like earthquakes on Earth, the Moon has "moonquakes." But don't worry—they're usually much smaller and less scary!<br/>
