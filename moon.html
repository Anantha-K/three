                    The Moon is a big, round rock that travels around our planet, Earth. It's like Earth's best buddy in space! The Moon shines at night because it reflects sunlight, and sometimes you can even see its craters and mountains through a telescope. It helps create ocean tides and has inspired countless stories and songs. Plus, it's the only place outside of Earth where astronauts have walked!<br/><br/>
                <b>Moonwalking</b>: Astronauts who visited the Moon did a special dance called "moonwalking." They bounced around because the Moon has less gravity than Earth. So, they felt super light and springy!<br/>
                <b>Moonlight is Just Sunlight</b>: The light we see from the Moon is actually sunlight bouncing off its surface. So, when you see the Moon shining, it’s like a giant mirror in the sky!<br/>
                <b>A Month is Based on the Moon</b>: The word "month" comes from the Moon! That's why some months have 28 or 29 days—just like the Moon takes about 29 days to go around Earth.<br/>
                <b>Moon Quakes</b>: Just like earthquakes on Earth, the Moon has "moonquakes." But don't worry—they're usually much smaller and less scary!<br/>
