          <p style="color: rgb(251, 251, 251)"class="card-text">The solar system is a vast and dynamic collection of celestial bodies that orbit around the Sun, a star at the center. It includes:

            <br><br>The Sun
            - The Heart of the Solar System: A massive ball of hot gas that provides light and heat, making life on Earth possible.
            
           <BR> The Planets
            There are eight major planets, which can be divided into two groups:
            
            <br> <br>Terrestrial Planets (Rocky)
            <br><br>1. Mercury: Closest to the Sun; small and rocky with extreme temperatures.
            <br>2. Venus: Similar in size to Earth but covered in thick, toxic clouds.
            <br>3. Earth: The only planet known to support life, with water and a breathable atmosphere.
            <br>4. Mars: Known as the red planet, with a dusty surface and the largest volcano in the solar system.
            
            <br>Gas Giants
            <br><br>5. Jupiter: The largest planet, famous for its Great Red Spot, a massive storm.
            <br>6. Saturn: Known for its stunning rings made of ice and rock particles.
               
            <br>Ice Giants
            <br><br>7. Uranus: An ice giant that rotates on its side and has a unique blue color.
            <br>8. Neptune: The farthest planet, known for its strong winds and deep blue appearance.
            
            <br>Dwarf Planets
            <br>In addition to the main planets, there are dwarf planets like Pluto, Eris, and Ceres, which are smaller and have not cleared their orbits of other debris.
            
            <br>Moons
            <br>Many planets have natural satellites called moons. For example, Earth has one moon, while Jupiter has over 79 known moons.
            
            <br>Asteroids and Comets
            <br>- Asteroids: Mostly found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, they are rocky remnants from the solar system's formation.
            <br>- Comets: Icy bodies that release gas and dust, forming glowing tails when they approach the Sun.
            
            <br>The Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud
            <br>- Kuiper Belt: A region beyond Neptune filled with icy bodies and dwarf planets.
            <br>- Oort Cloud: A hypothetical cloud of icy objects that surrounds the solar system and is thought to be the source of long-period comets.
            
            <br> Together, these components create a complex and fascinating solar system, with each part playing a role in the cosmic dance around the Sun.</p>
