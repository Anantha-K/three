                    Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth’s “sister planet” because they’re similar in size and composition. However, Venus is very different in many ways! It has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid clouds, which trap heat. This makes Venus the hottest planet in our solar system, even though it’s not the closest to the Sun!<br/><br/>
                <b>Hottest Planet</b>: Venus is like a giant oven, with surface temperatures around 462°C (864°F). If you tried to bake cookies there, they’d be done in a flash—if they didn’t melt first!<br/>
            <b>Pressure Cooker</b>: The atmospheric pressure on Venus is about 92 times that of Earth, which is like being a deep-sea diver without any gear! It’s like Venus is giving everything a big bear hug!<br/>
        <b> Beauty Contest</b>: Venus is often called the “Evening Star” or “Morning Star” because it’s so bright. If planets had a beauty contest, Venus would definitely win the title of “Miss Bright and Shiny”!<br/>
    <b>No Moons or Rings</b>: Venus is a lone planet, having no moons or rings. It’s the independent type who prefers to hang out by itself!<br/>
  <b>Retro Fashion</b>: Venus rotates so slowly that a day on Venus takes longer than a year! It’s like the planet is wearing retro clothes and taking its time to strut down the runway!<br/> </p>
