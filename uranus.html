                The seventh planet from the Sun and is known for its striking blue color, which comes from methane gas in its atmosphere. It’s a gas giant, just like Jupiter and Saturn, but it’s unique because it spins on its side! This means its rings and moons also orbit in a tilted position, making Uranus look like it’s rolling through space. It’s a chilly planet, far away from the warmth of the Sun!<br/><br/>
                <b>Tilted King</b>: Uranus is the only planet that rotates on its side, with an axial tilt of about 98 degrees. It’s like the planet decided to do a cartwheel and just kept going!<br/>
                <b>Ring-a-Ding</b>: Uranus has a set of faint rings, but they’re not as flashy as Saturn’s. They’re like the quiet cousins at the family gathering—still important but not stealing the show!<br/>
                <b>Far Away Friend</b>: Uranus is about 1.9 billion miles from the Sun, which means it takes a long time to complete one orbit—about 84 Earth years! If you were on Uranus, you’d have to wait a long time for your birthday!<br/>
                <b>Blue and Green</b>: Uranus has a beautiful blue-green color, making it look like a giant ice giant in space. If it were a flavor of ice cream, it would definitely be mint chocolate chip!<br/>
