                    Largest planet in our solar system, known as a gas giant. It’s made mostly of hydrogen and helium and has a swirling atmosphere with beautiful bands of clouds in shades of orange, brown, and white. Jupiter is famous for its Great Red Spot, a giant storm that’s been raging for hundreds of years—kind of like the biggest hurricane ever! Jupiter also has an impressive number of moons, with over 79 known so far, including its four largest, called the Galilean moons.<br/><br/>
                <b> Biggest Planet</b>: Jupiter is so huge that it could fit over 1,300 Earths inside it! It’s like the ultimate cosmic giant—think of it as the friendly giant of the solar system!<br/>
            <b>No Solid Surface</b>: Unlike Earth, Jupiter doesn’t have a solid surface to stand on. If you tried to land, you’d just sink into the clouds, like jumping into a fluffy cotton candy cloud!<br/>
        <b> Great Red Spot</b>: Jupiter’s Great Red Spot is a massive storm that’s bigger than Earth! If it were a party, it would be the biggest and windiest bash in space—better hold onto your hats!<br/>
    <b> Super Fast Spin</b>: Jupiter spins really fast on its axis, taking only about 10 hours to complete one rotation. It’s like the planet has had too much space coffee and can’t sit still!<br/>
